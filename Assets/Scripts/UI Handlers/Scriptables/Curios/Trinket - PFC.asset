  Description: A jar of purified crystal spice shimmers in the light. Used for its
    powerful medicinal benefits, this salt-like resource was mined by the mighty
    dwarven empire before the collapse. With few dwarves left the knowledge needed
    to obtain spice is locked away in the dwarven mountain halls. Legend has it in
    a time of great need, a warrior will rise from the dunes followed by the lost
    dwarves and wagons carrying enough spice to last a thousand years.
