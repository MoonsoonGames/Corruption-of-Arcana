  Description: "This ring once belonged to the first dark lord of arcana. Forged
    in a land beyond reach, it\u2019s infused with a mineral lost to history. Throughout
    the centuries the ring has been worn by many great leaders, each more corrupted
    by its dark energy than the last. Until its final owner was rumoured to be so
    haunted by the screeching voices of its previous wearers that he threw it into
    the ocean past the edge of the map, and yet, here it lays in the palm of your
    hand\u2026"
